I tested on 1GB mk802 with miniand lubuntu.
Resolution is fixed to 1280x720.

Installation:

Get miniand lubuntu with 720p resolution for your device from here:

https://www.miniand.com/forums/forums/development/topics/mk802-guides-and-images

After that install xbmca10.deb with the following command:

sudo gdebi xbmca10.deb

Starting:

sudo start xbmc

(Attention: this stops lightdm/x11-session, so it is a good idea to have ssh server running)

First start takes some time since xbmc creates the database and starts downloading plugins.
