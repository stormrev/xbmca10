Please look at depends.mk.
After adjusting run make && make -C xbmc.
If configure is done you can compile from the source root directory.

KNOWN PROBLEMS WITH HARDWARE RENDERING:
=======================================

- To enable hardware layer rendering you have to set environment A10HWR=1.

- Sometimes the display engine does not initialize correctly and not all
  colors get rendered or you get pixel noise. After some video startups this
  disappears.

- Using 1080p and alpha video blending there is a horrible screen tearing,
  for this reason alpha blending is disabled at 1080p for video at the moment.
  You can enable it (e.g. for tracking down the problem at kernel level) 
  by setting the environment variable A10AB=1.

- Not all xbmc video playback resolution settings are supported at the moment.

PLEASE REMEMBER: This is poc.
